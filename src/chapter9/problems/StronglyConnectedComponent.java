/**
 * <pre>
 *In a directed graph two vertices u and v are called strongly connected if and only if there exists path from u to v and
 * there is path from v to u.
 * 1) A vertex is strongly connected to itself.
 * 2) If a vertex u is strongly connected to vertex v then vice versa is also true.
 * 3) If a vertex u is strongly connected to v and v is strongly connected to x then u is strongly connected to x.
 *

 * 			^     /				|
 * 		    |   /				| it is 3 -> 4
 * 		    | /  				|
 * 		    2  					4
 *
 * 		    here 1 ->0, 0 -> 2 and 2 -> 1 is strongly connected, However 0 -> 3 is not.
 *
 *  In the above graph if we start the DFS from 0, 1 or 2 we will get a single tree, However doing so from 3t  o4 will 
 *  be a forest as graph can not traversed to all nodes starting from 3 or 4.
 *
 *  if we do a DFS of graph and store vertices according to their finish times, we make sure that the finish time of a
 *  vertex that connects to other SCCs (other that its own SCC), will always be greater than finish time of vertices in
 *  the other SCC(proof at http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Algorithms/MyAlgorithms/GraphAlgor/strongComponent.htm).
 *  For example, in DFS of above example graph, finish time of 0 is always greater
 *  than 3 and 4 (irrespective of the sequence of vertices considered for DFS). And finish time of 3 is always greater
 *  than 4. DFS doesnâ€™t guarantee about other vertices, for example finish times of 1 and 2 may be smaller or greater
 *  than 3 and 4 depending upon the sequence of vertices considered for DFS. So to use this property, we do DFS
 *  traversal of complete graph and push every finished vertex to a stack. In stack, 3 always appears after 4, and 0
 *  appear after both 3 and 4.
